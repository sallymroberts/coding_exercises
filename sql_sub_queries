__ Practice SQL sub-queries:
-- These were executed in an SQL session
-- and copied into this file.
-- Data obtained from Scene Francisco project
-- database and Hackbright auto database

-- Sub-query with self-join:
-- Select movie title, release year for
-- movies with the same release year as
-- Ant-Man, sequenced by movie title

SELECT m.movie_title, m.release_year
FROM Movies AS m
WHERE m.release_year = (
SELECT m2.release_year
FROM Movies AS m2
WHERE m2.movie_title = 'Ant-Man')
ORDER BY m.movie_title;


-- Sub-query with 2 tables using key word IN:
-- Select movie title, release year and location 
-- description for movies having filming 
-- locations that are filming locations for 
-- movies containing the word 'Alcatraz'
-- sequenced by movie title, location description

SELECT m1.movie_title, m1.release_year, l1.location_description
FROM Movies as m1 
JOIN Movie_locations as l1 
ON m1.movie_id = l1.movie_id 
WHERE l1.location_description IN
	(SELECT l2.location_description 
	FROM Movie_locations AS l2
	JOIN Movies AS m2 ON l2.movie_id = m2.movie_id
	WHERE m2.movie_title LIKE '%Alcatraz%')
ORDER BY m1.movie_title, l1.location_description;


-- Correlated sub-query with 2 tables:
-- Select brand, model, model year from Models
-- and Brand tables where brand is not 
-- discontinued and model year later than 1960

SELECT brand_name, models.name, models.year as model_year
FROM Models 
JOIN Brands ON brand_name = brands.name
WHERE brand_name IN (SELECT brand_name WHERE discontinued IS NULL AND models.year > 1960)
ORDER BY brand_name, models.name;
